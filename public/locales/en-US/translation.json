            "As a Scrum Master and Senior Software Engineer at CI&T, I've led cross-functional teams to deliver high-quality products for clients like The Coca-Cola Company. With over six years of experience, my skills encompass product visioning, team management, and leadership. My background as a back-end developer has allowed me to work on API development and front-end interfaces using NodeJS, Vue 3, AWS, Azure, React, and AEM. \nMy passion for team management and development drives me to foster motivation and career growth while eliminating blockers and orchestrating efficient sprints. I am currently pursuing an MBA in Project Management to enhance my leadership and management skills further.\nI am dedicated to creating collaborative and efficient work environments. An example is the comprehensive metrics collection system I implemented in Azure DevOps, where I created automation integrated with Google Sheets to facilitate data visualization and integration with the team. This process not only improved data transparency but also enabled more informed and agile decision-making.\nFeel free to reach out if you'd like to chat or exchange ideas ðŸ˜„"
