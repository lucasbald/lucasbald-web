            "Hi, I’m Lucas — a Project Manager with a strong background in software engineering and a real passion for Agile. Since 2018, I’ve been working with teams of all shapes and sizes, helping them deliver digital solutions that not only work but also create real impact for global brands. \n What I enjoy the most is bringing people together, connecting ideas, and turning complex challenges into simple, valuable outcomes. Along the way, I’ve worn different hats — Software Engineer, QA, Scrum Master, Agile Coach, and Project Manager — and each of them gave me a unique perspective on how to build better teams and better products. \n Outside the frameworks and metrics, I believe good leadership is about empathy, clear communication, and a bit of creativity (and humor!) to keep the team motivated. If you’re curious to know more about my professional side, you’ll find all the details on my LinkedIn — but here, I just wanted to give you a glimpse of the person behind the projects."
